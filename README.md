# YouTube Interactive Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a Python Dash version of my notebook on a sample of 207 channels with 150.899 videos from the YouTube Data API v3.
I've decided to create it after realising that notebooks using ipywidgets don't go well with cloud hosting like Google Colab or Kaggle.

The dataset contains the following features:
- Views
- Likes
- Dislikes
- Comments
- Age (days)
- Likes/dislikes
- Likes/views
- Dislikes/views
- Comments/views
- Comments/likes
- Comments/dislikes
- Mean views per day
- Mean likes per day
- Mean dislikes per day
- Mean comments per day
- Mean likes/dislikes per day
- Mean likes/views per day
- Mean dislikes/views per day
- Mean comments/views per day
- Mean comments/likes per day
- Mean comments/dislikes per day

* Apparently YouTube wont display the dislikes count anymore, which makes this kind of dataset even more interesting and possibly one of the last of its kind.
