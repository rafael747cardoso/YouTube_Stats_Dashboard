# YouTube Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a Python Dash version of my notebook on a sample of 126 channels and 109.845 videos from the YouTube Data API v3.
I've decided to create it after realising that notebooks using ipywidgets don't go well with cloud hostings like Google Colab or Kaggle.

The dataset used is the same:
- channel_title
- channel_id
- video_title
- video_id
- video_upload_date
- views
- likes
- dislikes
- comments
- age_days
- likes_dislikes_ratio
- comments_views_ratio
- mean_views_day
